# PlayWare
ðŸŽ® PlayWare is a lightweight, open-source game hub for Linux and Windows that brings together a collection of classic and modern text-based gamesâ€”including favorites like Contexto, Wordle, Pong, Snake, and many more. Think of it as a minimalist alternative to Steamâ€”except everything inside, from the games to the launcher itself, is completely free and fully open-source. Designed to be ultra-efficient, PlayWare runs seamlessly even on the most modest hardware, making it perfect for just about any setup.
