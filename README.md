# PlayWare
PlayWare is a linux application that has many text-based games in it like Contexto, Wordle, Pong, Snake and more!
It is like a game launcher like Steam but all the games and the program it self is 100% free and open-source and it is insanely light-weight so it can run on the weakest of hardware.
